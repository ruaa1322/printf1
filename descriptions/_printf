First we initialize all necessary variables, then we check if the format is NULL. If so, we return a negative integer
Then we iterate throught the format as long as it is not a null byte
if we run into a %, we check the next character for each of the stated cases and print their respective values as well as increase the length

This is a simple description of _printf
